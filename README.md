# HOW TO PLAY
Rules:

- The smaller tic-tac-toes reflect the big one, so wherever a player marks os the small ones, the next player will have to play on the sector referent to it on the big tic-tac-toe

- On the smaller tic-tac-toes, the sector is won as normal
 
- On the bic tic-tac-toe, the game is won by connecting 3 sectors in which a player has won in

- If the sector in which a player is supposed to play in is disabled (already won by a player or has no possible moves left), the player can choose whatever legal move on the board to play

- If there are no more possible moves left, the game ties
